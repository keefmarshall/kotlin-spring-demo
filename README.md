Spring Boot, Spring MVC basic reference project in Kotlin.
 
I generated this from start.spring.io and then implemented a basic 
controller of my own for testing.

Self reminder: null checks in Kotlin are important, need to be aware when
using annotated controller method parameters that might not
be populated.
